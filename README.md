## Analysis 

### Overview Section 

First page has a simple, clean style and highlights four key KPIs that provide an overview of the whole report.

### Order Section 

Investigate order-specific analytics, looking at patterns and consumer behavior. For more in-depth information, I've included a drill-down page that allows you to explore sizes, total pizza sales, categories, and average orders per hour.

### Revenue Section 

Get insightful information quickly on important company metrics and performance indicators. Make informed judgments by delving deeper into top sellers, revenue by day, and category with the use of interactive elements.

### Details Section 

Obtain thorough revenue data for every pizza, keeping track of components, sold pizzas, and the categories containing the best and worst-performing products. This section provides a detailed evaluation by showcasing the most and lowest revenue-generating pizzas. It also shows the average order amount and the average number of pizzas sold during peak hours. Here, we're using the Edit Interaction tool to preserve important KPIs.


### Tip to maximize profit section 

This gives the reports more depth and provides insightful information on profitable tips. I created engaging and interactive tooltips to improve the dashboard's appearance.
